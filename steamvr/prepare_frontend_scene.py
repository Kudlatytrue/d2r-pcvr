"""The main menu's act scenes (character select) in VR: a scene round you, not a picture before you.

The game opens on one preset for all five acts, data/hd/env/preset/ui/frontendact2.json: each act's
vignette is built for one fixed camera looking down -x, with painted imposter cards (forest, hills)
and a painted sky behind it, and nothing behind the camera. With [frontend] enabled the head stands
where that camera stands (vrcam CampfireView); this fills the rest round it:

  - the clouds' cards (FX_UIFrontEnd*_clouds) out: in the headset they stuck to the eyes;
  - round each prepared act, copies of its own ground, plants, stones, imposter cards and mountains,
    turned about the camera a quarter, a half and three quarters of a turn - only those that come to
    lie outside the front the game built (its own picture stays as it is), the ground a hair lower
    so that the scene's own wins where both lie, and what lies far pulled in toward the camera and
    scaled by the same share (the same size to the eye, clear of the next act's vignette).
  - Act 1: a leafy forest round you (the Dark Wood's trees, thickets, grass, the map's fields as asked);
  - Act 2: the desert outside Lut Gholein - its own plants, palms, mounds and rocks turned round, an oasis of
    palms behind you, big sand mounds as dunes, scrub, sand piles and rocks (SCATTER), all within SIDES.
